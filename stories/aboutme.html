        <p class="heading"> Hi! Sit back relax and read on to find out more about my background... <br><br></p>
        <h2> My Background </h2>
        <p>My background is quite diverse. Originally I studied Hotel Management. I worked as a Guest Relations Manager in a 5-star luxury resort hotel in Mumbai. Then I went back to school for my MBA in the US. Then I moved out west to the beautiful state
          of CO!</p>
        <h2> Senior Consultant at KPMG Consulting </h2>
        <p>I was a Senior Consultant with one of the big 5 accounting/consulting firms, KMPG Consulting. Practically each week, I traveled across the US, working on diverse client assignments, from Requirements Documentation and Project Management, to Product
          Manager for a telecommunications company in Denver, to optimizing a call center, to working on a CRM project in Washington D.C.</p>
        <h2> Project Management Director at Markit On Demand </h2>
        <p>Commuting across the country got old, so a couple of kids and a break later, I started at IHS Markit (then known as Wall Street On Demand and later Markit On Demand). I worked there for 6 years, as project manager for numerous financial clients,
          building financial products like stock screeners, stock and mutual fund pages, graphs and charts and other investment related pages. As a project management director, I met with clients on-site in Boulder or in the client's offices, and managed
          all aspects of the software development lifecycle, interfacing with both internal and client development teams.</p>
        <h2> Freelance Project Management</h2>
        <p>Untimately, being the middleman-who-does-not-actually-build-anything got a little frustrating. While it was nice to get the recognition for so many projects that went well, there were so many that didn't, and the powerlessness to do anything got
          more annoying. I found myself dabbling in "QA", by reading javascript code, finding issues using debug tools on the browser, running SQL queries to debug data issues. I had some development experience from way back in MBA school. I had liked
          it then, but circumstances had made me pursue a different line of work, more on the front end side. So anyway, I forged off into free-lance consulting for a little while. The idea was to get to experience project-managing in a smaller space.
          Get the chance to be a little closer to the development itself. Cut out some layers and beaurocracy and see if the life of a developer would be a good fit.</p>
        <h2> Software Development Education </h2>
        <p>Which brings me to the here and now, and my re-education/re-introduction to the world of coding!</p>
          <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>My first step was to to teach myself basic HTML and CSS, using a book recommended by an awesome developer friend: Head First HTML and CSS. It was a great start.</p>
          <h3> Javascript</h3>
          <p> I then headed into Javascript territory, using 2 books:
            <ol>
              <li>A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript By Mike Myers</li>
              <li>Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p>I learned the basics of jQuery using another book written by Mark Myers, called "A Smarter Way to Learn jQuery"</p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>I enrolled in an introduction to programming workshop through "Girl Develop It" and learned the basic syntax of Python programming. The book I used was a free online text by Real Python</p>
